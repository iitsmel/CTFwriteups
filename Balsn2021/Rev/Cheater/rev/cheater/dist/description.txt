As a CTF player, how do I sovle challenges and get the flags ?
NO, I don't ! I infiltrate spies into the CTF origanizers' family. 
Their girlfriend, boyfriend, wife, husband, adopted son and even their pet cat !
Spies will try to borrow their computer for playing a tiny tiny pixel-art video game... 
That's a trap! The game is actually a interface to contact headquarter for futher commands!
But a double secret agent stole my flag!
Haha, that's a bait, help me to found out which flag was leak so I can target the perpetrator.

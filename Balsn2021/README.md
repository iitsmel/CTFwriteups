ppc

Everyone knows birthday paradox. It takes 2^32 to find a collision.

To find another one, 2^32 * 2^32 == 2^64.

I know math!! It is infeasible!!

Notice - This task also tagged as ppc, and it requires some computational resources.

Ping your miner friends to get some GPUs, or try something like Google Colab. FYI, our PoC takes around 1hr on a single GPU (tested on 3060/2070/T4/P100).

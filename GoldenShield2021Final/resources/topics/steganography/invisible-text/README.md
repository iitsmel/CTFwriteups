# Hidden Text in Images

Text can be hidden by making it nearly invisible (turning down it's opacity to below 5%) or using certain colors and filters on it.  Although the text is indiscernible to the naked eye, it is still there, and there are a variety of tools which allow the text to be extracted.

## Use

	* [GIMP](http://www.gimp.org/) or [Photoshop](http://www.photoshop.com/) can be used to uncover the flag by using different filters and color ranges, as shown in the same [watermark guide](http://www.wikihow.com/Create-Hidden-Watermarks-in-GIMP) as above.

	* [Stegsolve](https://www.wechall.net/forum/show/thread/527/Stegsolve_1.3/page-1) is an immensely useful program for many steganography challenges, allowing you to go through dozens of filters to try to uncover hidden text.

	* There are many scripts that have been written to substitute certain colors and make hidden the text legible, for example [this](http://pastebin.com/46VmzrRU) Ruby script highlights colors passed to it in the image.

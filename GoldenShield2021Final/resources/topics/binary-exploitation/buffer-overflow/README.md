# Buffer Overflow
A buffer overflow occurs when a buffer (i.e., an array) is filled with more data
than it can hold. The excess bytes of data are written directly into memory,
often causing a [segfault](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Segmentation_fault) and crashing the program.


Vulnerable programs can be explioted to redirect the instruction pointer to
point to malicious code or [shell
code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shellcode).


Buffer overflows are common in compiled langauges like C and C++, where array
boundaries are not checked.

## Vulnerable Functions
The table below shows several C and C++ functions vulnerable to buffer overflows
and their safe alternative:

| Vulnerable	| Safe		|
| ------------- | ------------- |
| strcpy	| strncpy	|
| strcat	| strncat	|
| sprintf	| snprintf	|
| gets		| fgets		|

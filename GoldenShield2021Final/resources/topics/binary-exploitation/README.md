# Binary Exploitation

## Quick Start
* For C and C++ programs:
	* Does the program use functions like that do not check user input gets, strcpy, or sprintf?
		* If so, possible buffer overflow vulnerability!
	* Does the program use printf or snprintf without using a format specifier?
		* If so, possible format string vulnerability!

## About
> Binary exploitation is the process of identifying and taking advantage of
> vulnerabilities in compiled code. They can be used to read or corrupt memory,
> crash a program, or gain administrative access to a machine.
> In CTFs, the source code is usually written in C and the binaries, or
> executables, are in Linux ELF format.

## Examples
Example of a buffer overflow vulnerability:
```c
char buffer[32];
gets(buffer);	// what if 32 or more bytes are entered?

```

Example of a format string vulnerability:
```c
printf(argv[1]); // what happens if argv[1] = "%p %p %p %p"?
```

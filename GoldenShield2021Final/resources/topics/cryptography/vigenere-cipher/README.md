# Vigenère Cipher

The Vigenère Cipher is an encrypting method which uses a series of different Caesar ciphers based on the letters of a keyword. It was first developed in the mid-16th century, and has ever since been popular in the cryptography and code-breaking community. It was considered unbreakable until 1863, when Friedrich Kasiski published the first successful generic attack method of the cipher (although Charles Babbage probably managed to break it earlier, but didn't explain his method).

Several variants of the Vigenère Cipher exists, for example the Beaufort Cipher and the Gronsfeld Cipher. More recent ciphers, like the Enigma or the M-209 cipher machine, were also built on the same principles (polyalphabetic substitution ciphers).
